#
# Create a dynamic route at get '/reversename/:name' that accepts a name and renders the name backwards.
#
# Create a dynamic route at get '/square/:number' that accepts a number and returns the square of that number. Note: Remember that values in params always come in as strings, and your return value for the route should also be a string (use .to_i and .to_s).
#
# Create a dynamic route at get '/say/:number/:phrase' that accepts a number and a phrase and returns that phrase in a string the number of times given.
#
# Create a dynamic route at get '/say/:word1/:word2/:word3/:word4/:word5' that accepts five words and returns a string containing all five words (i.e. word1 word2 word3 word4 word5).
#
# Create a dynamic route at get '/:operation/:number1/:number2' that accepts an operation (add, subtract, multiply or divide) and performs the operation on the two numbers provided. For example, going to /add/1/2 should render 3.
